# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-Machine-Learning

This project is a Spam Email Classification System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. The system processes textual email data, applies feature extraction techniques, and trains a machine learning model to classify emails accurately.

<h2>üöÄ Features</h2>
<h6>Text Preprocessing:</h6>
Removes unnecessary characters, punctuation, and stop words.
Converts text to lowercase and applies stemming/lemmatization.
<h6>Feature Extraction:</h6>
Uses TF-IDF Vectorization or Bag of Words for numerical representation of text.
<h6>Machine Learning Models:</h6>
Supports classification models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest for spam detection.
<h6>Evaluation Metrics:</h6>
Calculates precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy for model performance.
<h6>Real-Time Prediction:</h6>
Allows users to input email content and predict if it is spam or not.

<h2>üìä Datasets</h2>
The project uses a publicly available dataset, such as the SMS Spam Collection Dataset or the Enron Email Dataset, for training and testing.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h2>
<h6>Python</h6>: Core programming language.
<h6>NLP Libraries</h6>: NLTK, SpaCy, or Scikit-learn for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
<h6>Machine Learning Libraries</h6>: Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
