# Spam-Email-Classification-using-NLP-Machine-Learning

This project is a Spam Email Classification System that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. The system processes textual email data, applies feature extraction techniques, and trains a machine learning model to classify emails accurately.

<h2>üöÄ Features</h2>
<h6>Text Preprocessing:</h6>
Removes unnecessary characters, punctuation, and duplication.
<h6>Feature Extraction:</h6>
Uses TF-IDF Vectorization or Bag of Words for numerical representation of text.
<h6>Machine Learning Models:</h6>
Supports classification models like Naive Bayes for spam detection.
<h6>Real-Time Prediction:</h6>
Allows users to input email content and predict if it is spam or not.

<h2>üìä Datasets</h2>
The project uses a publicly available dataset for training and testing.

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h2>
<h6>Python</h6>: Core programming language.
<h6>Pandas</h6>: For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
<h6>NumPy</h6>: For numerical computations and efficient data processing.
<h6>NLP Libraries</h6>: Scikit-learn for text preprocessing and feature extraction.
<h6>Machine Learning Libraries</h6>: Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
<h6>Streamlit</h6>: for enhanced user interface.

<h2>Installation</h2>
