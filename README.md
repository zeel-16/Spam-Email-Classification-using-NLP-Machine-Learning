# üìß Spam Email Classification using NLP & Machine Learning  

This project implements a **Spam Email Classification System** that leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to accurately classify emails as spam or legitimate. It processes textual email data, applies feature extraction, and trains a model for reliable classification.

## üöÄ Features  

- **Text Preprocessing**  
  - Cleans and normalizes text by removing unnecessary characters, punctuation, and duplication.  

- **Feature Extraction**  
  - Converts text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization** or **Bag of Words**.  

- **Machine Learning Models**  
  - Implements classification models, including **Naive Bayes**, to detect spam effectively.  

- **Real-Time Prediction**  
  - Allows users to input email content and instantly predict if it is spam or not.
